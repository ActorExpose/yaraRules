### yaraRules
 Each yara rule in this repo is mean't to match a malware sample.
If your interested in writing your own yara rules I reccomend checking out [this great page](https://yara.readthedocs.io/en/v3.4.0/writingrules.html).

### Malware
   All malware samples are password protected, mainly for my own safety, however the password to each rar is `infected`
   The sample I've got in here are all caught fresh in the wild, ive also included a table down below for finding any specific samples. If you have feedback, critique or any ideas on how I can improve this repo feel free to open an issue. I'm hoping to get this repo up to a solid 100 samples with yara's included. I've been looking for stuff that isn't just skidware.
Here are some of the current sites I've been using for gathering malware in mass:
[urlhaus](https://urlhaus.abuse.ch/) -  Great site for finding recent samples, its updated pretty often and open access.
[virustotal](https://virustotal.com) - Another great site for samples, however you need to request access which can take a bit of work.
[virusshare](https://virusshare.com/) - Love this site for the millions of samples which they have access to, you need to request permisson to gain access however.
